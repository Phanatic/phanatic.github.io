#### [HPE Helion Code Engine](https://docs.hpcloud.com/stackato/index.html#stackato/ops/quickstart_hce.html)

HPE Helion Cloud Engine allows enterprise developers to automate the build/test/deploy cycle triggered by checkins into Git repositories and into our Cloud Foundry runtime, with intermediate artifacts that are pushed to the Docker Hub or an organization’s Docker Trusted Registry. In addition, HPE Helion Code Engine also integrates HPE Software’s StormRunner tool for load testing a microservice once it’s been deployed to a staging environment—so out of the box, we not only streamline the process, we simplify the load testing, a common and needed safety check in an enterprise CI/CD process.
