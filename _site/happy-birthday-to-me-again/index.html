Its that time of the year again ! I grow a year older ,every year , on the year. This happened to me last year too and I have a strong suspicion it will happen next year too . 
Stuff I did over the last year . 
14th Jan 2008&nbsp;&nbsp; ,&nbsp; Joined the Astoria team. 14th Jan 2008&nbsp;&nbsp; ,&nbsp; Saw snowfall for the first time. 23rd Jan 2008&nbsp;&nbsp; ,&nbsp; Went Snowboarding for the&nbsp; first time. 23rd Jan 2008&nbsp;&nbsp; ,&nbsp; Ran into a tree while snowboarding for the first time. 28th April 2008 ,&nbsp; Went Sky-diving at Snohomish and didn’t jump off the plane ( got scared and canceled jump ). 15th May 2008&nbsp; ,&nbsp; Went hang-gliding at Tiger Hill , Issaquah ( yes , first time ).&nbsp; 5th July 2008&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ,&nbsp; Went River rafting for the first time in Wenatchee valley. 5th July 2008&nbsp;&nbsp; , Jumped head-first into a rapid just to see if I could , ( I could , don’t think I will ever do it again) 
I don’t know if I have become more adventurous or just suicidal. 
From a work perspective , &nbsp; Joined the only team I wanted to work for , the Astoria team. &nbsp; Worked with the team on Astoria Beta1 and RTM ,&nbsp; &nbsp; And the adventurous interim release of Silverlight Client library for RTM. &nbsp; I still can’t&nbsp; believe that I work for this team . &nbsp; Here’s to 27 years of living and loving !
