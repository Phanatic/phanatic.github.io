    <meta name="description" content="Hi ,
Over the past couple of months, I have been actively contributing to the Asp.net Ajax forums and have come across some very 
&nbsp;weird and challenging problems to solve.Anyone who's been at the forums can tell, the community is VERY Active and helpful when it comes to helping
out your fellow developer . Below is a list of some FAQs that I often encountered and was able to address on the&nbsp; Forums .
Helping someone out with a brain-bender they are stuck on and seeing the issue resolved after some brainstorming is VERY satisfying.
Why am I doing this ? 
There is a lot of content on the Forums and I wanna share what I learnt and was able to share with my fellow devs.
Also, I could have blogged about this but felt that its better to point you guys to the place where we learnt about this .
You might find some content duplicated from my Blog , as far as possible I have tried to avoid that and give you guys the unique ones that I have seen.

Tough ModalPopup Extender Question ( My Favorite )
Assigning Multiple Triggers to an AnimationExtender
Execute JavaScript on the client Side Before Showing a ModalPopup
Expand Accordion Pane WITHOUT clicking the header
Animate an Element's Property in JavaScript
Using client side calculated sizes for the Resize animation
Prevent repeat animation (animationextender) / ConditionalAnimation
How do I use Animation without server-side controls? (mission impossible??)
Hyperlink to a page with Accordion and opening a specific pane
Change visible Accordion Pane using JavaScript
Combine Animate and Modal dialog functionality
Create ModalPopupExtender control dynamically client side

&nbsp;
As time goes by , I will be putting up another list of issues that I helped on , 
these are the unique ( sort-of ) ones that I could find out of all the ones that I answered .
If you are not a part of the Forums , get yourself an account and start helping out !
Hope this helps someone out there !
