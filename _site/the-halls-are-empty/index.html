    <meta name="description" content="I probably brought this onto myself by taking all my vacation time in November to go back home for a month long visit.    
Now that its December , almost 80% of the team is on vacation and I am in office. Its not just my team , most of my floor     in building 35 is on vacation. I hardly see anyone in the hallways nowadays , the silence feels unusual.     Most of the people with whom I used to discuss any new ideas are on vacation , and not having anyone around     to bounce my ideas off of feels weird . Although , the silence lets me get a lot done though , no distractions.     
Thanks to the unusual ( in Redmond terms) snow, the campus shuttles are shut down for these snowed-in days .    That means my walk to work for&#160; a distance of mere 3 mile feels like 10 miles as I have to walk real slow     to prevent slipping on the ice and falling . And not to mention that it gets dark by 4 PM in the evening .     
So I go to work in the dark and go home in the dark, but only have an eight hour day.     Guess I can check off one of the items in the list of You Might be from the Pacific Northwest if You….     
This is how evenings look when I step out in the evenings to go home .     
Pretty awesome , isn’t it !    
Oh and before I forget , Happy Holidays Readers !!
