As a follow-up to my [previous blog post]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-05-12-Interviewing-At-Github %}), I'd love to talk about my experience these past few months at :octocat:. And compare that to my initial impression of the company from interviews.


Spoilers: I :100: :heart: it here.

I've divided my experience over the past few months in these sections so I can compartmentalize them better.

### <a name="work-environment"></a> Work Environment

GitHub has a beautiful space in San francisco, as [chronicled by this article](https://officesnapshots.com/2015/04/06/github-san-francisco-headquarters/). Close enough to the ferry building that you can have a pleasant walk
to the offices without breaking a sweat. Walking into the office, you can ask the friendly Barista to whip you up a delicious Cappucino for your early morning caffiene kick. There's an open bar on the ground floor, for responsible adults, and a free swag shop on the second floor, again, for responsible adults :smiley: .

When I accepted the offer, I had no idea what the office looked like.
All my interviews were over zoom, and I only looked up the building as I was about to go in for my first week of Orientation.

While I enjoy the beauty of the place and am thankful for the quite office space that 
allows me to write code, the office isn't the main enabler of my work satisfaction. 

Cliche though it might be, it is my co-workers at GitHub who've made these last few months extremely rewarding.
I get to work with amazing people who're very willing to teach and consequently have made me excited to `Pay It Forward` by teaching others. 

The phrase `"I might be wrong"` is often uttered without remorse or false humility. Having worked at a few places where self-deprecating comments plainly hid a sense of menace and were meant to shut down conversations, being at a place where I don't have to parse a sentence at multiple levels to understand it is wonderfully refreshing. The phrase opens up a conversation instead of shutting it down. As a listener, I feel excited to learn more about the problem space or the bug that they've been working on.

It is this open environment for learning and exploration that makes me feel excited to be here.
