As a follow-up to my [previous blog post]({{ site.baseurl }}{% post_url 2017-05-12-Interviewing-At-Github %}), I'd love to talk about my experience these past few months at :octocat:. And compare that to my initial impression of the company from interviews.


Spoilers: I :100: :heart: it here.

I've divided my experience over the past few months in these sections so I can compartmentalize them better.

### <a name="work-environment"></a> Work Environment
When we talk about a work experience, we don't really mean the tiling or the decor in the office building. 
We mean the nitty-gritty of Software Engineering, how progress is actually accomplished.


GitHub has a beautiful space in San francisco, as [chronicled by this article](https://officesnapshots.com/2015/04/06/github-san-francisco-headquarters/). Close enough to the ferry building that you can have a pleasant walk
to the offices without breaking a sweat. Walking into the office, you can ask the friendly Barista to whip you up a delicious Cappucino for your early morning caffiene kick. There's an open bar on the ground floor, for responsible adults, and a free swag shop on the second floor, again, for responsible adults :smiley: .

When I accepted the offer, I had no idea what the office looked like.
All my interviews were over zoom, and I only looked up the building as I was about to go in for my first week of Orientation.

While I enjoy the beauty of the place and am thankful for the quite office space that 
allows me to write code, the office isn't the main enabler of my work satisfaction. 

Cliche though it might be, it is my co-workers at GitHub who've made these last few months extremely rewarding.
I get to work with amazing people who're very willing to teach and consequently have made me excited to `Pay It Forward` by teaching others. 

The phrase `"I might be wrong"` is often uttered without remorse or false humility. Having worked at a few places where self-deprecating comments plainly hid a sense of menace and were meant to shut down conversations, being at a place where I don't have to parse a sentence at multiple levels to understand it is wonderfully refreshing. The phrase opens up a conversation instead
of shutting it down. As a listener, I feel excited to learn more about the problem space or the bug that they've been working on.

It is this open environment for learning and exploration that makes me feel excited to be here.

In my first week, I had to fix a bug where the comment count in the `Conversation` tab in a Pull Request was lesser than it should be√ü.
After investigating for a few days, I learnt that we missed joining with a table and implemented the fix.
Fresh off the sense of accomplishment, I went ahead to learn about my team and our product.
Two days later, I see the same bug bounced from support. But this time, the count was incredibly high for every PR. 
I reached out to my lead, Matt Yoho, and sheepishly told him that I introduced this bug into the system and was working on it immediately.

Matt was gracious and thanked me for taking over the issue, without a hint of `How did you miss a uniqueness constraint in a cross join?`
I was able to fix the bug in an hour and the fix was out a few hours later. There was no hand-wringing of the importance of the issue and who should work on it.
I was trusted to unbreak something that I broke, and before my self doubt at working in a new language/platform/application could catch up with me, the fix was in prod and the bug was resolved.
