<p>Hi ,</p>
<p>Over the past couple of months, I have been actively contributing to the Asp.net Ajax forums and have come across some very </p>
<p>&nbsp;weird and challenging problems to solve.Anyone who's been at the forums can tell, the community is VERY Active and helpful when it comes to helping</p>
<p>out your fellow developer . Below is a list of some FAQs that I often encountered and was able to address on the&nbsp; Forums .</p>
<p>Helping someone out with a brain-bender they are stuck on and seeing the issue resolved after some brainstorming is VERY satisfying.</p>
<p>Why am I doing this ? </p>
<p>There is a lot of content on the Forums and I wanna share what I learnt and was able to share with my fellow devs.</p>
<p>Also, I could have blogged about this but felt that its better to point you guys to the place where we learnt about this .</p>
<p>You might find some content duplicated from my Blog , as far as possible I have tried to avoid that and give you guys the unique ones that I have seen.</p>
