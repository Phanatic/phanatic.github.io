<p>Telerik has a range of controls that work with ADO.NET Data Services as the data source . Take a look at them here :</p>

<p>I wanted to address one small point in the blog post which I felt can be improved upon. </p>
<p><script src="http://gist.github.com/109416.js" mce_src="http://gist.github.com/109416.js"></script></p>
<p>“You might be curious why I chose to iterate through the list of categories in the report parameter value, calling the web service for each one and appending the results to a collection. <br />The reason is that, due to the limitations of ADO.NET Data Services, you can’t use methods like Contains to filter data in your LINQ queries.“</p>
<p>Yes , this is absolutely correct. <br />We don't support the “Contains” operator to select a primitive property of the Entity Type from a given range of values. <br />The client linq implementation doesn't support Contains on Navigation properties is because we don't have a URI Query operator&nbsp; that corresponds to the "Contains" function to select a value from a set. But you can semantically achieve the same effect by “OR”ing a couple of “EQUALS” expressions.</p>
<p>ex: </p>
<p>If A={0,1,2,3}&nbsp; , then A.Contains(B) is equivalent to ( B == A[0] OR B ==A[1] OR B == A[2])</p>
<p>I wrote about achieving this effect here :&nbsp; <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/phaniraj/archive/2008/07/17/set-based-operations-in-ado-net-data-services.aspx" mce_href="http://blogs.msdn.com/phaniraj/archive/2008/07/17/set-based-operations-in-ado-net-data-services.aspx">Set Based Operations in Ado.net Data Services</a></p>
<p>Now, in this sample , we are filtering an Entity Set (Products) based on the value of a primitive property ( CategoryID ) of a Navigation Property (Categories). <br />Now , since this is the Northwind model Schema, Products are related to categories in a 1..M association and Categories to Products in a 1..M association. </p>
<p>What this means is that the above query can be expressed as :&nbsp; <br /><span style="COLOR: green"></span></p>
<p><script src="http://gist.github.com/109412.js" mce_src="http://gist.github.com/109412.js"></script></p>
<p>Now , this is still not as optimal as it can be , but we reduced the number of round trips as we download only relevant categories and their associated Products. <br />To make this even easier , we use the IsIn&lt;T&gt; extension method I wrote from <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/phaniraj/archive/2008/07/17/set-based-operations-in-ado-net-data-services.aspx" mce_href="http://blogs.msdn.com/phaniraj/archive/2008/07/17/set-based-operations-in-ado-net-data-services.aspx">Set Based Operations in Ado.net Data Services</a>.</p>
<p><script src="http://gist.github.com/109419.js" mce_src="http://gist.github.com/109419.js"></script></p>
<p>So , there you have it , we reduced the number of network calls and also the lines of code to achieve this filtering.</p>
<p>On a side note , <a href="http://blogs.telerik.com/blogs/09-05-02/saying_goodbye_hellip.aspx" target="_blank" mce_href="http://blogs.telerik.com/blogs/09-05-02/saying_goodbye_hellip.aspx">Kevin has left Telerik</a> and now blogs at : <a title="http://www.myviewstate.net/blog/" href="http://www.myviewstate.net/blog/" mce_href="http://www.myviewstate.net/blog/">http://www.myviewstate.net/blog/</a></p>
<p>All the best for your future endeavours Kevin !!</p>
