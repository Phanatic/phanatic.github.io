<p>As part&nbsp; of the v1.5 install, we also shipped a Silverlight 2.0 SDK library that is capable of talking to a v1.5 Astoria Service. </p>
<p><strong>Did you know that you could use the Silverlight 2.0 client library we shipped as part of our v1.5 CTP1 release in Silverlight 3.0 applications?</strong></p>
<p>From a Silverlight SDK library point of view ,to use <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/MFlasko" mce_href="http://blogs.msdn.com/MFlasko">Mike Flasko’s</a> words, ”we are nothing but user code”. <br />We have no dependencies on the Runtime that have changed in SL 3.0 , <strong><em>yet</em></strong>. <br />So , you can use the Silverlight 2.0 SDK library that we shipped in v1.5 CTP1 , by <br />replacing the reference to “System.Data.Services.Client.dll” with “Microsoft.Data.Services.Client.dll”</p>
<p>In your Silverlight project , </p>
<p>1. If you already have a reference to “System.Data.Services.Client.dll” in your SIlverlight application , remove it .</p>
<p>2. If you have the v1.5 CTP1 installed , the Silverlight client binaries are stored in the following location , <br /><span style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffcc00">%ProgramFiles%\ADO.NET Data Services V1.5 CTP1\sl_bin</span></p>
<p>3. Bring up the “Add Reference” window by right clicking the “References” node for the Silverlight 3.0 Project in Visual Studio.</p>
<p>4. Use the “Browse” tab of the “Add Reference” window to browse to this location to add a reference to “Microsoft.Data.Services.Client.dll”.</p>
<p>5. Rebuild and run the app . </p>
<p><a></a></p>
<p><strong>What about Code-gen , <br /></strong><strong>Can I point the Silverlight 3.0 application at a v1.5 CTP1 service and get all the binding &amp; Friendly Feeds mappings generated in the Client types?</strong></p>
<p><strong>No </strong>, there is no integration for v1.5 codegeneration tools in Visual Studio for Sl 3.0 Projects . <br />You will have to use the DataSvcUtil.exe tool from the following directory manually to generate the types with binding information for SL 3.0 projects .</p>
<p>Location for DataSvcUtil.exe : <span style="BACKGROUND-COLOR: #ffcc00">%ProgramFiles%\ADO.NET Data Services V1.5 CTP1\bin</span></p>
<p><strong>From a runtime perspective , is there any functionality in the v1.5 SL 2.0 library that is not present when the dll is inside a xap built with SL 3.0 tools ?</strong></p>
<p>No , none , everything should just work . If something doesn’t work , please leave a comment on this post or write to me at PhaniRaj At Microsoft Dot Com.</p>
<p><strong>What about Silverlight 3 Out-Of-Browser applications ?</strong></p>
<p>The Astoria Silverlight client library doesn’t yet work with Out of the Browser Silverlight applications.</p>
