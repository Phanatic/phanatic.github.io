<p>Its that time of the year again ! <br />I grow a year older ,every year , on the year. <br />This happened to <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/phaniraj/archive/2007/09/17/happy-birthday-to-me.aspx" mce_href="http://blogs.msdn.com/phaniraj/archive/2007/09/17/happy-birthday-to-me.aspx">me last year</a> too and I have a strong suspicion it will happen next year too . </p>
<p>Stuff I did over the last year . </p>
<p>14th Jan 2008&nbsp;&nbsp; ,&nbsp; Joined the Astoria team. <br />14th Jan 2008&nbsp;&nbsp; ,&nbsp; Saw snowfall for the first time. <br />23rd Jan 2008&nbsp;&nbsp; ,&nbsp; Went Snowboarding for the&nbsp; first time. <br />23rd Jan 2008&nbsp;&nbsp; ,&nbsp; Ran into a tree while snowboarding for the first time. <br />28th April 2008 ,&nbsp; Went Sky-diving at Snohomish and didn’t jump off the plane ( got scared and canceled jump ). <br />15th May 2008&nbsp; ,&nbsp; Went hang-gliding at Tiger Hill , Issaquah ( yes , first time ).&nbsp; <br />5th July 2008&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ,&nbsp; Went River rafting for the first time in Wenatchee valley. <br />5th July 2008&nbsp;&nbsp; , Jumped head-first into a rapid just to see if I could , ( I could , don’t think I will ever do it again) </p>
<p>I don’t know if I have become more adventurous or just suicidal. </p>
<p>From a work perspective , <br />&nbsp; Joined the only team I wanted to work for , the Astoria team. <br />&nbsp; Worked with the team on Astoria Beta1 and RTM ,&nbsp; <br />&nbsp; And the adventurous <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/phaniraj/archive/2008/09/03/interim-release-making-sl2-beta-2-clients-work-with-net-fx-3-5-sp1-rtm-servers.aspx" mce_href="http://blogs.msdn.com/phaniraj/archive/2008/09/03/interim-release-making-sl2-beta-2-clients-work-with-net-fx-3-5-sp1-rtm-servers.aspx">interim release of Silverlight Client library for RTM.</a> <br />&nbsp; I still can’t&nbsp; believe that I work for this team . <br />&nbsp; <br />Here’s to 27 years of living and loving !</p>
