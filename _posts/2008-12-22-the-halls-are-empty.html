<p>I probably brought this onto myself by taking all my vacation time in November to go back home for a month long visit.    </p>
<p>Now that its December , almost 80% of the team is on vacation and I am in office. Its not just my team , most of my floor     <br />in building 35 is on vacation. I hardly see anyone in the hallways nowadays , the silence feels unusual.     <br />Most of the people with whom I used to discuss any new ideas are on vacation , and not having anyone around     <br />to bounce my ideas off of feels weird . Although , the silence lets me get a lot done though , no distractions.     </p>
<p>Thanks to the unusual ( in Redmond terms) snow, the campus shuttles are shut down for these snowed-in days .    <br />That means my walk to work for&#160; a distance of mere 3 mile feels like 10 miles as I have to walk real slow     <br />to prevent slipping on the ice and falling . And not to mention that it gets dark by 4 PM in the evening .     </p>
<p>So I go to work in the dark and go home in the dark, but only have an eight hour day.     <br />Guess I can check off one of the items in the list of <a target="_blank" href="http://www.skrause.org/humor/northwest.shtml">You Might be from the Pacific Northwest if You</a>….     </p>
<p>This is how evenings look when I step out in the evenings to go home .     <br /><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/64066546@N00/3126800793/"><img style="border-right-width: 0px; display: inline; border-top-width: 0px; border-bottom-width: 0px; border-left-width: 0px" title="DSCN0333" border="0" alt="DSCN0333" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/DSCN0333.jpg" original-url="http://blogs.msdn.com/blogfiles/phaniraj/WindowsLiveWriter/Thehallsareempty_1275B/DSCN0333.jpg" width="244" height="184" /></a></p>
<p>Pretty awesome , isn’t it !    </p>
<p>Oh and before I forget , <strong>Happy Holidays Readers !! </strong></p>
